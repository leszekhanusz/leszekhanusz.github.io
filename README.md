Simple Artist Contact Website
=============================

This is a simple contact website used to display the portfolio of an artist (paintings or pictures).

The website is static using old school html and css and does not need any build step.

All the paintings and the artist photo were generated by Stable Diffusion.

It uses the [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com) javascript library for the nice image gallery.


Local testing
-------------

To test it locally, you need to start a local web server.

You can do it with Python for example by running in `./src`:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

Publishing it
-------------

To publish it and host it somewhere, you need to manually upload the content of the `src` folder to your hosting space.
